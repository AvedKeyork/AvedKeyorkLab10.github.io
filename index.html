            <h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
            <p>There is one SEO technique very important using meta tags. These tags make the website rank better by circling it with the relevant search queries. Let us take an example, suppose the meta description like 'Affordable web design services for small businesses', this will tempt users looking for the similar services. (Source: Lockard, n.d.)</p>
            <p>Making descriptive and unique titles is also an efffective SEO strategy,  And page titles make an appearance on search engine results pages (SERPs); making them often the first impression users get of the website.ncluding targeted keywords in the title not only improves SEO but also helps users quickly understand the webpage's purpose, making it more likely for them to click on the link (Source: Bruce Clay, n.d.).</p>
            <p>Having heading tags used correctly matters in regards to importance of SEO. These tags will help you organize your content hierarchically so that the search engine crawlers can understand how the webpage is structurally. Using headings with relevant keywords further enhances visibility and ensures a better user experience (Source: SitePoint, n.d.)</p>

            <h2>Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h2>
            <p>Adding social media sahre buttons will encourage users to share content with others allowing for some traffic to ocure from social media to the website.Also, it makes the brand more noticeable as users interact in the social platforms of the website. (Source: Lockard, n.d.)</p>
            <p>Another good SMO tip is to develop interesting multimedia content, like that on Instagram for instance. Visually appealing images and videos will get you sharing them on Instagram, which will increase your engagement rates and attract new followers. Whatâ€™s better is that it allows people to explore and share content more conveniently, thus improving social interaction.(Source: Bhargava, 2010)</p>
            <p>Last but not least, creating headlines that will make people want to share your content will increase SMO. For instance posts with hashtags or tagging influencers can help increase the reach of the posts.(Source: SitePoint, n.d.).</p>
